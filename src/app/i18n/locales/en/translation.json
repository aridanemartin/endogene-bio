At EndoGene.bio, we will be helping women across the world get access to early diagnosis through cutting-edge epigenetics.</p><p>Endometriosis affects 10% of women, takes 7 years to diagnose and has high societal and economic costs. In the EU and US alone, the estimated cost of delayed diagnosis reaches €300B.</p>",
    "intro2": "<p>This is caused by a lack of specific and early tests. At EndoGene.Bio, we are developing a prescription diagnostic test based on epigenetic biomarkers found in menstrual blood that patients can take in the comfort of their home</p><p>With this technology, we will reduce time to diagnosis from 7 years to two consultations: one to get your test done, one to get your results.</p>"

    "endometriosis": {
      "definition": "Endometriosis is a complex gynecological condition characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, which induces a chronic, inflammatory response. This tissue, behaving similarly to the lining of the uterus, thickens, breaks down, and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. However, because it is located outside the uterus, it has no way to exit the body, leading to pain, inflammation, and the formation of scar tissue. Symptoms can vary but often include severe menstrual cramps, chronic pain in the lower back and pelvis, pain during or after sexual intercourse, intestinal pain, and infertility in some cases.",
      "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of endometriosis can be notably challenging and is frequently delayed. On average, it takes from 7 to 10 years from the onset of symptoms for a woman to receive a definitive diagnosis. This delay is due to a combination of factors, including the normalization of menstrual pain, the variability of symptoms, and the necessity for a definitive diagnosis to be made through laparoscopy—a surgical procedure that allows a physician to observe the pelvic organs directly and take tissue samples for examination. The complex nature of endometriosis and the broad spectrum of its manifestations contribute to the prolonged period many women experience before receiving an accurate diagnosis."

    "menstrual_blood_diagnosis": {
      "importance": "Menstrual blood, often regarded as waste, serves as an excellent diagnostic tool. It contains materials shed during menstruation, such as endometrial tissue, immune cells, proteins, and microorganisms. In fact, menstrual blood boasts over 300 unique proteins not found in other blood or body parts. The proportions of different cell types in menstrual blood differ significantly from those in other areas of the body, presenting novel diagnostic targets.",
      "method": "Using menstrual blood for diagnostics is non-invasive and does not require a needle. This method offers the potential to identify diseases, determine a patient's likely response to specific treatments, and predict current health status. Furthermore, it can forecast future risks of gynecological or reproductive disorders in subsequent menstrual cycles."
    },
    "epigenetics": {
      "definition": "Epigenetics explores how environmental factors and behaviors influence gene expression. Throughout our growth and development, various factors act on our genome, regulating the activation and deactivation of genes at specific times and locations. These regulatory mechanisms can be significantly affected by our environment and lifestyle choices, such as stress levels, or whether an individual smokes. Consequently, these influences may lead to changes that activate or deactivate genes in ways that deviate from their normal patterns.",
      "importance": "Crucially, alterations in these regulatory factors can lead to diseases by improperly activating or deactivating genes."
